# Questions and Answers Generator

> An Artificially Intelligent Questions and Answers Generator created as a part of my internship at Webology.

>Python and deep learning algorithoms are used to generate questions and answers from text

>Concepts from natural language processing, deep learning, and neural networks were used in this project.

>A simple web application is used to display the input and the output of the program.

>The user inputs thier text and the program would then extract information from it. This information would then be used to generate questions and thier respective awnsers with alternative choices to go along with it.

>The output is in the style of a multiple choice question.

>Run packages.ipynb to install the required packages

>Run main.py to execute the web app then follow the instructions on the terminal.
